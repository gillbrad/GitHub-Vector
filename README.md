Create a simple C++ project that will read Cartesian coordinates from a text file (data.txt) and populate a vector and perform some simple mathematical operations on the vector.
To build:
1. From build dir run cmake $ cmake ..
2. From build dir run make

After make completes an exe named Vector.exe should be created
